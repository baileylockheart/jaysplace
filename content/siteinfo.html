    <h3>Stuff to know about this site!</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>This site was initially started in April of 2023, as my first ever coding project! However, the site is now on its SECOND version, which I began work on in January of 2025! If you'd like to see the previous version, check the <a href="#archive">archive</a>. All information about the site listed here is in reference to the current version!</p>
    <p>This site was made using a Static Site Generator called Eleventy! Because it allows me to make my own templates to reuse, it made everything a lot quicker/easier WITHOUT sacrificing the freedom to do what I want with it! I really like it and would highly reccomend :3</p>
    <p>This site is being built on desktop and is intended to be mobile-compatible, but it's still a bit funky looking on tablets. Also, there is no autoplay music or video on this site!</p>

    <h2>Content Warnings!</h2>
    <div id="lr">
        <p><b>This site is generally safe for work and those under 18.</b> Some areas may have content that requires a warning, but they will have them listed on the page before the content.<br>
        <br>I don't expect this site to be particularly dark, but it is intended to be less "clean" than my other sites. Because of that, may be some mild swearing, but that's about it for the time being. This may change in the future, but if it does, it'll most likely be its own section with a dedicated warning.</p>
