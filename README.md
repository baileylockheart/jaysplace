# Jay's Place ✧˖°
Jay's Place was my first ever website, and it's undergone a lot of changes since I first set it up! Despite the attachment I have to it, I've somewhat abandoned it in favor of other websites. 

Still, that doesn't mean I don't care about it or that I don't want to keep it around, which is why I'm keeping the code here! I'm also using this as an opportunity to test out pushing from github to neocities ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶
