Hey there! :D please don't take/copy my code! I put a lot of time into it, and also, there are probably a lot of issues in it that would NOT benefit your site :')    
Feel free to read through it for light inspiration if you want to though, and also pls let me know if you see anything wrong with it ;-; I wanna make this site the best I can!

                <p><b>December 4, 2024: </b>It's been an EXTREMELY long time, but I've made a few minor tweaks and made it so that the website is being pushed from github! Feel free to check out <a id="color02" href="https://github.dev/baileylockheart/jaysplace" target="_blank">this repository</a> if you wanna see the inner workings of this site, or check out the rest of the account if you wanna see what I'm up to :D</p>
                <p><b>October 26, 2023: </b>MASSIVE BUT INTENTIONALLY SUBTLE OVERHAUL <sub><sup><sub>&#129321;&#129321;</sub></sup></sub> I wanted to reorganize some things since I'm better at coding than I used to be! I wanted it to be a little less clunky and a little easier to navigate on this side of things, and I think that's going well!</p>
                <p><b>October 21, 2023: </b>hiiii... I've been gone again. Oops. Anyway, only a few small updates this time! The most noticable is that I added DimDen's Navlink ads, so you can check out other people's sites too ^-^ I feel like I haven't been doing much here, so this is some passive support + a place for people looking at my page to go!</p>
                <p><b>September 11, 2023: </b>I've been working on quite a few little side-projects, none of which were this site (sadly), and I decided to come back and look at my code. And WOW it's very messy <sub><sup><sub>ðŸ˜­</sub></sup></sub> So, I went through and fixed up the parts that were glaringly painful to look at. Let's hope I didn't break anything! :D</p>
                <p><b>July 7. 2023: </b>I made a new <a id="color02" href="https://jaysplace.neocities.org/blog/7-21-2023%20~%20School%20Chromebook" target="_self">blog post</a>! I've been mostly gone for quite a while, but I wanted to make a liiiittle update hehe</p>
                <p><b>May 28, 2023: </b>It took me a bit to get around to making it, but WE'VE GOT A SKZ SHRINE NOWWWW</p>
                <p><b>May 26, 2023: </b>Sorry for the disappearance, turns out that procrastination was a big factor in my frequent updates :') Anyway, I think(?) I made a sitemap! I have no clue if it actually fits the definition of a sitemap, but I still think it's neat :D</p>
                <p><b>May 8, 2023: </b>I made my first shrine and made a completely separate layout for it, and I'm honestly shocked that it turned out so well! I have no intention of changing my current layout ofc, but it's so much cleaner, I can practically FEEL myself improving</p>
                <p><b>May 7, 2023: </b>This was an impulsive decision but I now have a <a id="color02" href="https://video-hosting-for-neocities.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">tumblr blog</a>, SPECIFICALLY for hosting videos so people who can't upload videos to their neocities sites can still have videos on them haha</p>
                <p><b>May 6, 2023: </b>Added in pre-loaders and now we've got stamps :D</p>
                <p><b>May 5, 2023: </b>holy HECK big update, I separated the blinkies from the links, I re-organized all the images, put spans in the places where divs were being disagreeable, and now I have a graphics page!</p>
                <p><b>May 3, 2023: </b>I added a spotify widget thingy :D some titles might get cut off but STILL</p>
                <p><b>May 2, 2023: </b>Pretty important update, I added flash warnings to all the pages with blinkies and fast-moving GIFs on them! :D</p>
                <p><b>May 1, 2023: </b>I already crossed some stuff off the to-do list <sub><sup><sub>ðŸ’€</sub></sup></sub> but anyway, huge change to the sidebar, I added a microblog, and now there's a whole page of just buttons and blinkies! I might turn it into a general links page, but I like the buttons for now :D</p>
                <p><b>April 30, 2023: </b>Small little update, but I made a to-do list :)</p>
                <p><b>April 25, 2023: </b>I cleaned up my CSS a little bit, and set up a little status update thingy :D</p>
                <p><b>April 22, 2023: </b>I joined another webring bc why not, I did a liiiittle customization to the widget hehe, I made a 404 page, and also, I made a few more changes, so things should be running a bit smoother now!</p>
                <p><b>April 21, 2023: </b>I tried pulling up the site on a different computer and it was VERY slow, so I made some changes to hopefully speed up the loading times :)</p>
                <p><b>April 19, 2023: </b>I joined a webring :D</p>
                <p><b>April 17, 2023: </b>Yet another big update, but there's a blog section now, and most importantly, PETER IS CLICKABLE NOW (^O^)</p>
                <p><b>April 16, 2023: </b>Massive update to this site just a day later, for no reason other than being able to. But also I needed to get the ideas out so I can focus on the assignments that are due in literally two hours T-T also, idk what I did but Peter's not working so I'm sticking the link <a id="color02" href="https://gifypet.neocities.org/pet/pet.html?name=Peter&dob=1681708342&gender=m&element=Air&pet=hamster.gif&map=tree.jpg&background=https://jaysplace.neocities.org/images/background.png&tablecolor=black&textcolor=black" target="_blank">here</a> until I figure that out lol</p>
                <p><b>April 15, 2023: </b>I should be doing school right now. However. Neocities caught my attention and refused to give it back... Although I probably should get back to school ;-; I'll add more stuff here soon!</p>
